## Lessons in this tutorial

These lessons are organized according to the operations used:

### [Restriction operators](docs/restrictions.md)

These operators restrict, or filter, the input sequence to produce an output sequence.

- [Where clause syntax](docs/restrictions.md#where-clause-syntax)
- [Where clause using a property](docs/restrictions.md#restrict-elements-based-on-a-property)
- [Where clause with multiple conditions](docs/restrictions.md#restrict-elements-based-on-multiple-conditions)
- [Where clause drilldown into results](docs/restrictions.md#drilldown-into-output-elements)
- [Where clause with element index](docs/restrictions.md#using-the-indexed-where-method)

### [Projection operators](docs/projections.md)

- [Select clause syntax](docs/projections.md#select-clause-syntax)
- [Select a single property](docs/projections.md#select-a-single-property)
- [Transform types with select](docs/projections.md#transform-with-select)
- [Select a new type](docs/projections.md#select-anonymous-types-or-tuples)
- [Create new types with select](docs/projections.md#use-select-to-create-new-types)
- [Select a subset of properties](docs/projections.md#select-a-subset-of-properties)
- [Select including the index of source item](docs/projections.md#select-with-index-of-item)
- [Combine select and where](docs/projections.md#select-combined-with-where)
- [Select from multiple sequences](docs/projections.md#select-from-multiple-input-sequences)
- [Select from related input sequences](docs/projections.md#select-from-related-input-sequences)
- [Select multiple sequences with where](docs/projections.md#compound-select-with-where-clause)
- [Select many with assignment](docs/projections.md#compound-select-with-where-and-assignment)
- [Select many with multiple filters](docs/projections.md#compound-select-with-multiple-where-clauses)
- [Select many with element index](docs/projections.md#compound-select-with-index)
